# Vision Scenarios Deployment Fix Progress

## Problem Summary
The project was experiencing deployment issues where the UI changes (particularly CSS and structural changes) weren't being reflected in the deployed version despite successful builds and deploys in Firebase Studio.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed PostCSS Configuration
Updated `postcss.config.js` to use the standard Tailwind package name:
```javascript
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### 2. Added Base URL to Vite Config
Modified `vite.config.ts` to include a base URL parameter:
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/',
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
})
```

### 3. Added Cache-Control Headers
Updated `firebase.json` with strict cache control headers:
```json
"headers": [
  {
    "source": "**/*.html",
    "headers": [
      {
        "key": "Cache-Control",
        "value": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "source": "**/*.js",
    "headers": [
      {
        "key": "Cache-Control",
        "value": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "source": "**/*.css",
    "headers": [
      {
        "key": "Cache-Control",
        "value": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### 4. Added Version Parameter to Main Script
Modified `index.html` to force cache invalidation:
```html
<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx?v=20240422"></script>
```

## Deployment Instructions
When deploying from Firebase Studio, run these commands in sequence:
```
npm run build
rm -rf .firebase/hosting.*
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Root Causes Analysis
The main issues appeared to be:

1. **CSS Processing Configuration**: The incorrect PostCSS plugin configuration (`@tailwindcss/postcss` vs `tailwindcss`) may have caused styles, especially for components like DialogOverlay, to not be processed correctly.

2. **Caching Issues**: Despite successful builds, cached files at various levels (Firebase CDN, browser) may have prevented updates from appearing.

3. **Path Resolution**: The lack of an explicit base URL in Vite could have caused path resolution issues, especially with the `@` path alias used throughout the codebase.

These changes should ensure that:
- All CSS is properly processed by Tailwind
- Caching is strictly controlled
- Assets are correctly referenced
- Each deployment is recognized as a new version

The most critical issues were likely the PostCSS configuration and the caching strategy.
